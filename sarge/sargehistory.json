AA-guns are buildings and require an upgraded HQ. all infantry is created at a barraks, all vehicles are made at a garage, and all buildings are made by a bulldozer. to make certain units, such as advanced infantry and vehicles, you must upgrade your barraks and garage. certain units can only be made with certain buildings, such as minelayers and medics at garages, or bulldozers and dump trucks at the HQ. you also have a HQ, or headquarters, which must stay alive at all costs, if it is destroyed, you have 3 minutes to rebuild it or you lose the war. medics can heal or repair any unit or building, but they are defenseless. you also must gather plastic and electricity from various sources to create soldiers. you can get plastic and electricity from household items such as toys, VHS tapes, and batteries. you also need dump trucks to gather plastic and a depot to collect it from the trucks. the depot only collects plastic and electricity, it can't do anything else, they are high priority targets. you start every game with a bulldozer and of course yourself, you always need to build an HQ. your focus is on defending yourself while destroying the current enemy. keep your own soldiers alive while killing as many of the enemy as possible.\nfull list of units:\n infantry:\n grunt\n grenadier\n minesweeper\n machine gunner\n bazooka man\n sniper\n mortar man\n \n vehicles:\n
